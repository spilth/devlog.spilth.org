- Third first entry...
- Blah blah blah...
- Foo
- Bar
- Some things I looked up to write this:
- http://blog.jayfields.com/2006/12/ruby-multiline-strings-here-doc-or.html
- http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html
- And inspired by http://sourcefu.com/
- Probably a good idea to ignore blank input
- Need to figure out if I want to commit posts to github hourly/daily
- And if I want to publish to github Pages or Amazon S3
- Should also figure out some way to turn URLs into links
- And since I'm using Markdown I should be able to create headers... except everything is a bullet point right now. Woops.
- This should ignore blank lines now
- Non-blank line.
- Carriage return isn't considered an empty string
- so Chomping before test now. some blank lines
- non-blank line
- TODO: A more graceful way to exit other than Control-C
- TODO: Determine if I want to timestamp entries so I can link directly to them
- TODO: Type 'mistake' do undo the last entry? For those times when I start entering vim commands here...
- I guess I can also get into the practice of entering URLs using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
- Using Markdown syntax, that is.
- But bare URL conversion would be nice too so I don't have to think too much when posting URLs
- The source for this is at [https://github.com/spilth/devlog.spilth.org](https://github.com/spilth/devlog.spilth.org)
- This might prove handy for uploading to Amazon S3 [guard-s3](https://github.com/guard/guard-s3)
- Consider writing files out to an interim format and then converting that to HTML and/or Markdown, especially if I want timestamped entries presented as a table, a la [#sourcefu's logs](http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/today)
- Above should've been a TODO (and I tried to use vim commands to jump to the beginning of the line...)
- Really what you're witnessing is just me talking to myself.
- TODO: Consider if this should just be integrated into my personal site and not a completely separate site/domain.
- TODO: Also need to consider how this is different from my [Personal Notes](http://spilth.org/notes/), if they are at all.
- For one, my "notes" are more organized and edited. This "devlog" is more just a dump of thoughts and information. Not meant to be edited afterwards.
- I carelessly upated my gems and the new jekyll-s3 gem seems to now set permissions of content-types correctly so my site be came 403 Forbidden.
- The issue is described here [https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/jekyll-s3/issues/11](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/jekyll-s3/issues/11) and is supposedly fixed, but it didn't start working for me until I downgraded my jekyll-s3 gem
- `gem 'jekyll-s3', '0.0.5'`
- `bundle install`
- `bundle exec jekyll-s3`
- Nice that the new version (2.0.0) only uploads changed files, though. That will be handy if I can figure out the permission issue.
- Testing this out on my personal laptop now.
