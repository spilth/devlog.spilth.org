2012-12-16T00:17:36-05:00	Got image, vimeo and youtube tags working in Jekyll, so it has me wondering if I want to start blogging on my main site instead of Tumblr.
2012-12-16T00:19:39-05:00	I do like the exposure and automatic community that Tumblr provides, but I also like everything under one site with a consistent look.
2012-12-16T00:20:27-05:00	Then there's the question of wether I'll migrate any of the content from there. I could also just keep smaller/less serious post on Tumblr or just post about stuff I like there and actually write about things on my blog.
2012-12-16T00:21:41-05:00	And wether I'll migrate my old Wordpress posts or not. Probably not.
2012-12-16T15:28:55-05:00	TODO: Make a gallery tag that lets me easily display a few images using Twitter Bootstrap's mediagrid, instead of just stacking images in paragaraph tags.
