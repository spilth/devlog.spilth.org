2012-12-07T00:09:06-05:00	First entry using timestamp,message CSV and custom converter
2012-12-07T00:10:07-05:00	Test
2012-12-07T00:15:42-05:00	And another test entry
2012-12-07T00:15:56-05:00	Now to add IDs for linking...
2012-12-07T00:20:47-05:00	TODO: Highlight the row being linked when using # links
2012-12-07T00:40:47-05:00	Need to remember that this won't do any Markdown processing now, unless I add it!
2012-12-07T00:42:06-05:00	BUG: Since I'm using CSV now I can't use commas in my entries. Woops!
2012-12-07T00:42:47-05:00	Will fix tomorrow. Up way too late now.
2012-12-07T09:17:06-05:00	Switched from commas to tabs, so this comma should work now
2012-12-07T09:30:58-05:00	Today's lesson: make sure you're looking at localhost for changes to your output, not the S3 site that hasn't been updated yet.
2012-12-07T11:33:36-05:00	So an incident that spurred the creation of this devlog...
2012-12-07T11:33:59-05:00	I needed to generate a list of Subversion Repositories we have in Anthill Pro.
2012-12-07T11:35:07-05:00	[RepositoryFactory](http://docs.urbancode.com/anthill-api-3.7/anthill3-remoting/api/com/urbancode/anthill3/domain/repository/RepositoryFactory.html) has the method `restoreAllForType(java.lang.Class<? extends Repository> repoType) ` which returns an array of `Repository`.
2012-12-07T11:36:22-05:00	As I loop through them (in a Velocity template) I need to cast them to [SvnRepository](http://docs.urbancode.com/anthill-api-3.7/anthill3-remoting/api/com/urbancode/anthill3/domain/repository/svnrepository/SvnRepository.html) so I can call `getSvnRoot()` on them. So I needed to cast an array of one class it an array of its superclass.
2012-12-07T11:37:27-05:00	I found the answer in his StackOverflow question: [How to convert object array to string array in Java](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1018798/8252).
2012-12-07T11:37:45-05:00	So in the end, my code is doing this:
2012-12-07T11:37:49-05:00	`Repository[] repos = RepositoryFactory.getInstance().restoreAllForType(SvnRepository.class);`
2012-12-07T11:37:59-05:00	`SvnRepository[] svnRepos = Arrays.copyOf(repos, repos.length, SvnRepository[].class);`
2012-12-07T11:47:10-05:00	I suppose I could've done the cast for each repo within the Velocity template as well.
2012-12-07T11:56:39-05:00	Totally cheated and edited some entries using vim to fix borked Markdown syntax.
2012-12-07T11:57:11-05:00	Need to consider the value of timestamped entries and limited/manual editing vs. stream of consciousness.
2012-12-07T11:57:35-05:00	Stream of Consciousness probably doesn't mix well with formatting things for Markdown - it requires thought.
2012-12-07T13:34:44-05:00	Is there any value/functionality to adding hashtag support? Like using #todo or #anthillpro to easily find all entries about a topic?
2012-12-07T14:03:30-05:00	Sourcefu.com has a nice [search functionality](http://irclog.greptilian.com/search.pl?channel=sourcefu) but as my devlog is a static site currently I'd have to rely on google for searching the site. Weary of having to set up a web app for this... though I suppose [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) could be lightweight enough.
